## Projects
### An Investigation of Distance-Based Statistical Methods in High Dimensions
[Repo](https://github.com/aterzy42/CurseofDimensionality)

When dealing with high dimensional data, common statistical tools often become ineffective. This thesis examines causes of these issues through an exploration of high dimensional spaces. We present some counterintuitive mathematical and statistical results from a geometric view. These results are exploited to modify an existing classification method and also introduce a new test statistic for the general distribution free two-sample problem. Other applications are briefly considered.

### Retention Analysis on Cookie Cats Mobile Game: A/B Test with Permutation and Bootstrap Tests
[Repo](https://github.com/aterzy42/Cookie_AB)

We are testing whether changing the first gate in a popular mobile game from level 30 to level 40 has a significant impact on user retention. To do this, we apply Permutation Tests to assess if the observed differences in retention rates are statistically significant, and Bootstrap to calculate confidence intervals for the retention differences. The goal is to understand whether the new feature has a meaningful impact on short-term and long-term user engagement.

### Predicting Clicks On a Real Estate Posting
[Repo](https://github.com/aterzy42/Property_Click)

This project focuses on developing a predictive model to estimate user interactions with real estate listings posted on NoBroker, a popular online platform in India. The assignment, which was posted on StrataScratch, challenges participants to build a model that forecasts how likely users are to interact with various listings on the website. The task involves analyzing rent amount, location, and others factors  that influence interactions.

### Using Spline Regression
[Repo](https://github.com/aterzy42/Spline)

Spline regression is a method used to model complex, nonlinear relationships between variables by fitting piecewise polynomial functions. It divides the data into segments and fits a low-degree polynomial to each segment, ensuring smooth transitions at the boundaries (called "knots"). This approach allows for flexibility in capturing non-linear trends while avoiding overfitting. The report and beamer presentation includes an implementation of spline regression in R, demonstrating its application for modeling such relationships.

### Should I Invest Streamlit Dashboard
[Repo](https://github.com/aterzy42/StockAnalysis)

This project leverages a Random Forest classifier to predict whether a stock will experience a relative price change greater than 1 compared to the S&P 500. The prediction model is deployed through an interactive Streamlit dashboard, where users can customize various valuation metrics to generate stock predictions. Additionally, the dashboard features a dedicated tab that allows users to select a stock by ticker and retrieve company descriptions, as well as data on institutional and insider ownership, which are scraped using BeautifulSoup. The project also includes an exploratory data analysis (EDA) notebook and the complete code for the dashboard implementation.

### Obligatory Projects:

### Simple OCR
[Repo](https://github.com/aterzy42/DigitHighlighter)

This project uses several classical image processing techinques to extract the digits written on a notepad. A classifier is also trained on the MNIST dataset using Keras.

### Spam Filter
[Repo](https://github.com/aterzy42/SpamFilter)

This project uses the UCI SMS Spam Collection dataset to build a model that classifies SMS messages as spam or not. It involves cleaning and transforming the text data through feature engineering (like removing stop words and extracting message length) and applying TF-IDF to highlight important words. Different machine learning models are trained to predict whether a message is spam or not.

### Titanic Prediction
[Repo](https://github.com/aterzy42/Titanic)

Can't have a portfolio without the Titanic project! This project is all about predicting survival rates for passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning. The goal is to build a model that can determine whether a passenger survived or not, based on a set of features like age, sex, class, and fare.
