## Work Experience
**ANALYTICS MANAGER @ Spotter (_October 2022 - November 2024_)**
- Leveraged advanced analytic techniques such as retention and cohort analysis to estimate future cash flows of unconventional financial products offered to YouTube channels.
- Led the development of a forecasting model to predict revenue per thousand views on YouTube videos using Python and SQL, improving valuation accuracy and significantly reducing manual underwriting time.
- Collaborated with the sales team to craft compelling data-driven narratives to pitch to global creators and their teams, resulting in the closure of high-value deals worth several million dollars. Regularly developed
ad-hoc SQL queries to organize data and create insightful reports in Excel.
- Streamlined data using SQL and created a comprehensive Power BI report to track valuation performance
metrics, delivering actionable insights to the underwriting and modeling teams.

**MACHINE LEARNING SPECIALIST â€“ COMPUTER VISION @ Bluehalo (_September 2019 - October 2022_)**
- Developed multiple anomaly detection methods in Python for satellite imagery and created a PyQT5-based GUI for image annotation, enabling effective training for object detection.
- Built a state estimation pipeline using OpenCV employing several image processing techniques, including key point extraction, centroid estimation, and symmetry detection.
- Delivered presentations to stakeholders, offering clear interpretations of methodologies and actionable insights for strategic planning and next steps.

**TEACHING ASSOCIATE, MATHEMATICS @ California State University, Northridge (_August 2017 - May 2020_)**
- Delivered engaging lectures and recitations for precalculus and higher-level courses.
- Provided tutoring, support during office hours, and graded assignments and exams.
- Led a summer intensive on data science for incoming students, guiding them through coding, statistics, and
machine learning, culminating in successful Kaggle challenge submissions.

**RESEARCH SCHOLAR - MACHINE LEARNING @ Air Force Research Laboratory (_June 2019 - August 2019_)**
- Applied different regression models to predict the effectiveness of specific weapon designs, uncovering new insights into critical performance factors.
- Created advanced visualizations with Matplotlib that uncovered patterns and previously unnoticed similarities among outliers, leading to further research.
- Partnered with cross-functional teams from academia, government, and industry to present findings and tackle complex research challenges.
  
## Projects
### An Investigation of Distance-Based Statistical Methods in High Dimensions
[Repo](https://github.com/aterzy42/Spline)

When dealing with high dimensional data, common statistical tools often become inef- fective. This thesis examines causes of these issues through an exploration of high dimensional spaces. We present some counterintuitive mathematical and statistical results from a geometric view. These results are exploited to modify an existing classification method and also introduce a new test statistic for the general distribution free two-sample problem. Other applications are briefly considered.

### Using Spline Regression
[Repo](https://github.com/aterzy42/Spline)

Spline regression is a method used to model complex, nonlinear relationships between variables by fitting piecewise polynomial functions. It divides the data into segments and fits a low-degree polynomial to each segment, ensuring smooth transitions at the boundaries (called "knots"). This approach allows for flexibility in capturing non-linear trends while avoiding overfitting. The report and beamer presentation includes an implementation of spline regression in R, demonstrating its application for modeling such relationships.
